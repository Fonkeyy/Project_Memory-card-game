# Project Memory Card Game

## Project Overview
The Memory Card Game project is the second milestone in The Odin Project's React course. In this project, I created Memory Counter Skins, a memory game set in the Counter-Strike universe. The objective is to click on different weapon skins as quickly as possible.

## 🚀 Learning Highlights
- **API Integration**: I integrated the Counter-Strike API using the Fetch API, providing an opportunity to work with real-world data in a web application.
- **UseEffect hook**: This project marked my first implementation of the useEffect hook. It enabled me to efficiently manage and update data based on player choices, enhancing the game's functionality.

## ⚡️ Features
- **Weapon selection**: Players can choose their desired weapon skin to enhance their gaming experience and add an extra layer of personalization to the game.
